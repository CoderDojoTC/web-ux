# HTML Links

HTML links are created using the HTML anchor element ```<a/>```.  The anchor has an attribute with the name of ***href*** that is used to hold the URL of the page to go to when the link is clicked.  Here is an example:

```html
<a href="http://example.com/mypage.html">Link to mypage</a>
```

You can use the HTML anchor tag to make many elements clickable, not just text.  So you can put images and buttons inside the content of the anchor element.

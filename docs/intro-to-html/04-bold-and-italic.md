# Adding Bold and Italic to HTML
HTML allows us to add bold and italic to any text in a document.  To do this we need to wrap the text in ```<b>``` elements for bold and ```<i>``` elements for italics.

Here is an example of adding bold and italic to a paragraph of text.
```html
<p>HTML allows us to add <b>bold</b> to any text that we want to
 <b>emphasize.</b>.  We can also add <i>italic</i> text or a 
 combination of both<b><i>bold and italic</i></b>.
</p>
```
Which will render like this:
<p>HTML allows us to add <b>bold</b> to any text that we want to <b>emphasize.</b>.  We can also add <i>italic</i> text or a combination of both
<b><i>bold and italic</i></b> elements turned on.
</p>

!!! Warning
     You must remember to close the bold and italic markup.  They don't just apply to a single world.  Make sure you close the elements in the reverse order that you added them.

# HTML Headings

HTML headings appear in the ```body``` element.  They have different levels and get smaller in font as you increase the heading level.  Sometimes the first level heading ```<h1>``` is 
use as the title of the document.  If you have a large document then ```<h2>``` might be the chapter headings and ```<h3/>``` might be the chapter sections.

```html
<h1>Article Title</h1>
<h2>Chapter Heading</h2>
<h3>Chapter Section</h3>
<h4>Chapter Subsection</h4>
<h5>Chapter Sub-Subsection</h5>
```

Here is how these would render:

<h1>Article Title</h1>
<h2>Chapter Heading</h2>
<h3>Chapter Section</h3>
<h4>Chapter Subsection</h4>
<h5>Chapter Sub-Subsection</h5>

Note that by default, headings always appear on their own line.  However, you can use CSS to change the font size, font color, spacing around the headers and add border and color to the background of a header.

# HTML File Structure Structure


## Getting Started Template
Here is a standard template we will be using for our example programs.

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
   <head>
      <meta charset="utf-8"/>
      <title>A simple HTML document</title>
    </head>
   <body>
      <p>Hello World!<p>
   </body>
</html>
```

## DOCTYPE
There are many varieties of HTML files.  This line indicates that
this file conforms to the most common modern format HTML5.

## html
This is the root element.  The begin tag should be the second line of the file and the end tag the last line of the file.  The html element contains two parts.  The first is the head that hold the title and data about the content and the body has the page content itself.


## head
The head element contains information about the page content.  This includes the page title that appears on the browser tab.  It is a good best practice to pick a short but descriptive page title.

## body
The body element contains the page content itself.

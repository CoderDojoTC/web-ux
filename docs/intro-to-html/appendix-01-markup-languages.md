## Markup languages

A [markup language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language) is used to encode details of a document, where the markup language is not displayed in the final result.

### Daily Examples of Markup languages

If you have ever changed a font size, or made a font bold, you have used a *markup langauge*.

- When writing on paper, writing a "carror" (`^`) character to insert words, underlining a title, crossing out an error
- Footnotes in a book
- Microsoft word Headings (Header 1 , Header 2, Header 3), headers, footers, margins

<h1>Anatidae</h1>
<p>
The family <i>Anatidae</i> includes ducks, geese, and swans,
but <em>not</em> the closely related screamers.

# Introduction to CSS

Making a website often uses these three coding languages: HTML, CSS, and Javascript. HTML includes the basic building blocks- the words you see on the website and more. Working hand in hand with HTML, CSS can change color, sizing, and spacing. In other words, CSS changes the style. If you don't want your website to change at all, HTML and CSS have you covered. Otherwise, Javascript is used to make a website interactive.

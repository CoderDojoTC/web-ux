## Personas Definition

Personas are archetypical users whose goals and characteristics represent the needs of a larger group of users.  Personas are typically are created by creating a single page description of an individual that represents all the users in this class of users.  Personas help us define the background, motivations and personality characteristics of a class of users.

## Why are Personas Important?
Deep understanding of a target audience is fundamental to creating exceptional products. Personas help a product team find the answer to one of their most important questions, “Who are we designing for?” By understanding the expectations, concerns and motivations of target users, it’s possible to design a product that will satisfy users needs and therefore be successful.

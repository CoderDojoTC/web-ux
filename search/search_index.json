Just like a tree, HTML files have a single root (think of a trunk), many branch elements that contain other elements, and finally leaves of the tree that contain the text that we display on a page. Elements are usually composed of pairs of tags - begin tags and end tags. Here are the main parts of an element: The begin tag is the start of the element. It always starts with a \"less then\" character and ends with a \"greater than\" character. The begin tag can have many attributes which are name-value pairs The name-value pairs are composed of attribute names, followed by an equal sign, followed by the attribute values surrounded by double quotes The begin and end tags surround the element text. This is usually the leaf element or other branch elements The element text is followed by an end tag. Note that the end tag has the same characters as a begin tag but it also has a forward slash after the less-than character. What is difficult to understand is that elements can contain other elements which in turn can contain other elements. Here is an example of this tree structure: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 <root> <branch> <branch> <branch> This is the leaf text. </branch> </branch> </branch> <root> It is also interesting to note that it does not matter where you put newlines (carriage returns) between the branch elements. HTML will render the same within the browser. The following is the same as the markup above: 1 2 3 <root><branch><branch> <branch> This is the leaf text. </branch> </branch></branch><root> If you are new to markup languages, this terminology of \"elements\" and \"attributes\" and the rules will seem a bit odd at first. However, as you begin to use it you will learn to appreciate how allowing us to be flexible with the way spaces are used when we create the HTML files to be convenient. It allows us to use consistent rules for how to display the test on a web page. Empty Elements \u00b6 There are some places in an HTML file where the contents of the element is empty. For these elements there is no end element and you add a forward slash before the greater then. Examples of empty elements: 1 2 3 < br /> <!-- newline break --> < img src = \"myimage.jpg\" /> <!-- image with no text value --> < input type = \"text\" id = \"firstName\" name = \"firstName\" /> <!-- input field -->","title":"Elements and Attributes"},{"location":"intro-to-html/01a-elements-and-attributes/#elements-and-attributes","text":"HTML is composed of a tree-structure of things called \"elements\".

In this lab we will take a look at this structure and see how the elements work together to describe the way a web page is laid out and rendered. Getting Started Template \u00b6 Here is a standard template we will be using for our example programs. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 <!DOCTYPE html> < html lang = \"en\" > < head > < meta charset = \"utf-8\" /> < title > A simple HTML document </ title > </ head > < body > < p > Hello World! < p > </ body > </ html > DOCTYPE \u00b6 There are many varieties and versions of HTML files. This line indicates that this file conforms to the most common modern format: HTML 5. html \u00b6 This is the root element. The begin tag should be the second line of the file and the end tag the last line of the file. The html element contains two parts. The first is the head that hold the title and data about the content and the body has the page content itself. The lang=\"en\" tells web crawlers that the language of this web page is English. head \u00b6 The head element contains information about the page content. This includes the page title that appears on the browser tab. It is a good best practice to pick a short but descriptive page title. The <meta charset=\"utf-8\"/> element indicates that the encoding character set is UTF-8. This is the preferred format for encoding web pages. body \u00b6 The body element contains the page content itself. The elements within the body elements hold the structure of the web page and the text that is rendered within each element. Block and Inline Elements \u00b6 The body element contains two types of elements: Block elements always starts on a new line and takes up the full width available. Block elements stretch out to the left and right as far as the layout permits. Block elements are used to arrange large regions of page layout. Inline elements do not start on a new line and it only take up as much width as necessary. They are frequently used to change the way individual words are displayed within text blocks. For example you can use an inline element to change the font or color of a few words within a line of text. One of the tricky things about learning HTML layout is to understand the rules of how block and inline elements work together.","title":"HTML File Structure"},{"location":"intro-to-html/02-html-structure/#html-file-structure","text":"HTML files all have a consistent structure of elements and attributes.

Both methods have pros and cons. If you are deploying a single web site that you want consistent behavior, it is best to include all the images in your own web site and then use a relative path to the images. If you want to share images between multiple areas of the web site they should be place in a common folder, typically named the img folder. Relative paths start with that folder name. The alternative is to directly reference images on the web using a full URL that starts with http:// . This has the advantage of being portable as long as that the path to the image does not change. However, you sometimes can't guarantee that a remote web site will not move images around or change their file names. So to be fully in control of your image references, use a relative path.

In some inputs such as checkboxes and radio button the label occurs before the input. You can use CSS to determine how your form is styled.

You create a variable with the keyword let (or var) followed by a name for your variable. 1 2 3 4 let name = 'Bob'; console.log('My name is ' + name); name = 'Alice'; console.log('My name is ' + name); Naming variables \u00b6 You can call a variable pretty much anything you like, but there are limitations. Generally, you should stick to just using Latin characters (0-9, a-z, A-Z) and the underscore character. You shouldn't use other characters because they may cause errors or be hard to understand for an international audience. Don't use underscores at the start of variable names \u2014 this is used in certain JavaScript constructs to mean specific things, so may get confusing. Don't use numbers at the start of variables. This isn't allowed and causes an error. A safe convention to stick to is so-called \"lower camel case\", where you stick together multiple words, using lower case for the whole first word and then capitalize subsequent words. We've been using this for our variable names in the article so far. Make variable names intuitive, so they describe the data they contain. Don't just use single letters/numbers, or big long phrases. Variables are case sensitive \u2014 so myage is a different variable from myAge. One last point: you also need to avoid using JavaScript reserved words as your variable names \u2014 by this, we mean the words that make up the actual syntax of JavaScript! So, you can't use words like var, function, let, and for as variable names. Browsers recognize them as different code items, and so you'll get errors. Variable Types \u00b6 There are a few different types of data we can store in variables. Note: JavaScript is a \"dynamically typed language\", which means that, unlike some other languages, you don't need to specify what data type a variable will contain (numbers, strings, arrays, etc). Numbers \u00b6 You can store numbers in variables, either whole numbers like 30 (also called integers) or decimal numbers like 2.456 (also called floats or floating point numbers). You don't need to declare variable types in JavaScript, unlike some other programming languages. When you give a variable a number value, you don't include quotes: 1 let myAge = 15 Strings \u00b6 Strings are pieces of text. When you give a variable a string value, you need to wrap it in single or double quote marks; otherwise, JavaScript tries to interpret it as another variable name. 1 let myName = 'John'; Booleans \u00b6 Booleans are true/false values \u2014 they can have two values, true or false. These are generally used to test a condition, after which code is run as appropriate. So for example, a simple case would be: 1 let isLoggedIn = false; Arrays \u00b6 An array is a single object that contains multiple values enclosed in square brackets and separated by commas. 1 2 let myNameArray = ['Chris', 'Bob', 'Jim']; let myNumberArray = [10, 15, 40]; Objects \u00b6 In programming, an object is a structure of code that models a real-life object. You can have a simple object that represents a box and contains information about its width, length, and height, or you could have an object that represents a person, and contains data about their name, height, weight, what language they speak, how to say hello to them, and more. 1 let dog = { name : 'Spot', breed : 'Dalmatian' }; To retrieve the information stored in the object, you can use the following syntax: 1 dog.name Constants \u00b6 Constants are used to store values that are immutable or can't be changed and are created with the keyword const. 1 const daysInWeek = 7; const works in exactly the same way as let, except that you can't give a const a new value. In the following example, the second line would throw an error: 1 2 const daysInWeek = 7; daysInWeek = 8;","title":"Variables"},{"location":"intro-to-javascript/02-variables/#variables","text":"Variables are containers for values (such as numbers, or strings of text).

They were not very different from the Turtle Graphics drawings that we generated in Scratch or with our turtle graphics libraries in Python. But now we will start to really show how the SVG standard is really impressive. And this is where SVG paths come in. In SVG, the path operator is considered the most powerful tool in our drawing library! The d attribute is the way that that we pass our drawing data to the path element. But d is really, really smart. It knows how to move to any point in our drawing area and then use relative horizontal and vertical drawing commands from that initial moveto point. Here are the three initial \"commands that we will use: M - move to any X,Y point H - move Horizontally V - move Vertically L - draw a line to a given point (Lineto) Simple Paths with Move, Horizontal, Vertical and Lineto Commands \u00b6 Here is the path element used to draw a simple square 1 2 3 4 < svg width = \"100\" height = \"100\" > < path d = \"M 10,10 H 90 V 90 H 10 L 10,10\" fill = \"none\" stroke = \"blue\" stroke-width = \"3\" /> </ svg > Closing Your Path With \"Z\" \u00b6 Sometimes you don't want to put in that last Lineto command. You can just use the letter \"z\" to tell it where to go back to the starting point. 1 2 3 4 < svg width = \"100\" height = \"100\" > < path d = \"M 10,10 H 90 V 90 H 10 Z\" fill = \"none\" stroke = \"blue\" stroke-width = \"3\" /> </ svg > Curve commands \u00b6 Now that you have the basics of path commands drawing straight lines, lets have some fun with drawing curves. You can always draw curves with lots and lots of small short lines. But it is very inefficient to send thousands of little drawing commands to the web browser. What if we could just tell the web browser to draw a graceful curve between points? That is where the SVG Path Curve command comes in handy. To create a curve you need to: 1. Define the endpoints - the start and the end of the curve. 2. Supply one or two \"control points\" that govern the general shape of the curve. A B\u00e9zier curve with one control point is called a quadratic B\u00e9zier curve (Q command) and the kind with two control points is called cubic (C command). C - Draw a Cubic B\u00e9zier curve using x1 y1, x2 y2 and x y Q - Draw a Quadradic B\u00e9zier curve using x1 y1, x2 y2 and x y Here is the SVG code that draws a curve from (10,10) through 100,100 and ends at (200, 10). 1 2 3 4 < svg width = \"100\" height = \"100\" > < path d = \"M 10,10 C 20,20 100,100 200,10\" stroke = \"black\" fill = \"transparent\" /> </ svg > Here is what it looks like: Note that there are a few differences. We don't just add the center point of the curve. We also tell the direction to proceed from the origin (in a diagonal line from 10,10 to 20,20) is one additional point.

They were not very different from the Turtle Graphics drawings that we generated in Scratch or with our turtle graphics libraries in Python. But now we will start to really show how the SVG standard is really impressive. And this is where SVG paths come in. In SVG, the path operator is considered the most powerful tool in our drawing library! The d attribute is the way that that we pass our drawing data to the path element. But d is really, really smart. It knows how to move to any point in our drawing area and then use relative horizontal and vertical drawing commands from that initial moveto point.
